# js-tail-log

> A tail -f like implementation in javascript with included colorizing support


## Installation

```

```

jstail will be installed into your bin path.


## Usage

```
jstail [file][options]
```

## Flags

### color

Deactivates colored output:

```
-c --color
```

### custom config
Pass a custom config [path]:

```
-s --setting <config>
```

### silent
Suppress all errors:

```
-q --quiet
```

### debug mode
Show debug messages:

```
-d --debug
```

### replay
Replay a log file with an optional interval(default 1sec):  

```
-r --replay <interval>
```

## Configuration

jstail can work with different configurations. It can colorize output based on some patterns. When hundreds of log messages appear its hard to see which of them are errors and which are just info messages.

The default configuration is the following:

```json
{
    "initLines": 10,
    "colorNeutral": "\u001b[0m",
    "patterns": [
        {
            "name": "debug",
            "expr": "(DEBUG)",
            "color": "\u001b[35m"
        }, {
            "name": "info",
            "expr": "(INFO)",
            "color": "\u001b[36m"
        }, {
            "name": "warn",
            "expr": "(WARN)",
            "color": "\u001b[33m"
        }, {
            "name": "error",
            "expr": "(ERROR)",
            "color": "\u001b[31m"
        }
    ]
}
```

The expressions are matched as regular expressions and can be as simple as those above.

jstail will look in your homefolder for a file `.jstail` then in your current directory and finally you can also pass a custom configuration with the \-\-setting parameter.

***Configuration order:***

`setting config > current directory config > home config > defaults`

Make sure youâ€™re using a valid json file as configuration or else it will be ignored

## Output
